Invoker is a project built for [Lumohacks 2017](https://www.lumohacks.com)

Invoker is an Android app designed for parents. Invoker allows parents to keep track of the children's moods and track changes over time. Invoker alerts the parent to consistent shifts in the childs mood or activities. This early warning system allows parents to notice subtle changes over time that they may not catch otherwise.

We hope that Invoker, if implemented properly, could help catch the symptoms of diseases such as anorexia nervosa, depression, and addiction.
